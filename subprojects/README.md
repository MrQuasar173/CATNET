# Subprojects
This isn't a vendor directory. We'll it kind of is. Then what is it, I hear you ask? Well, Meson has something called wrap files, which are basically a way of downloading dependencies. See their wiki for more information. Meson needs the directory to be called subprojects, so thats why it's called that instead of vendor.
