# CATnet
CATnet is a more desentralized web for a more modern age. This repository holds the source code for both the Daemon and the Server, but not the client.

## Code Guidelines
In order to make CATnet easier to maintain and understand, we follow the [CppCoreGuidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines). If you need to find out how to style a specific C++ feature, please use your browsers built in search function, or clone it onto your system and `find . | grep x`.
The first time you use a feature (even if it is trivial, such as function declaration), please look up the prefered way to use it in the guidelines.

## Git Workflow
Pretend the other people working on this code base are insane, have a shotgun, and know where you live. As such, please follow `WORKFLOW.MD`.
